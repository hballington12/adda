# Getting started...

To get started with ADDA on the UHHPC cluster, we need to add the source files to the cluster. One possible location for this is in your \home directory. At the time of this post, the storage quota for your home directory is 50 GB. The ADDA source code takes up approximately 100 MB of space so it's acceptable to put these in your home directory, for now. To clone the ADDA source files, we will use PuTTY, which is used for establishing a secure connection between our device and one of the head nodes on the cluster.

1. First, open PuTTY and log on to the cluster with your username and password.
